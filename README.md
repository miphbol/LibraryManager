Library Manager is a library management system by which users can add, view, edit, remove Books and their respective Authors and Loans. 
It is meant to track which books are currently lent out and when they are due for return. Within this program there are a few seeded examples.

In this current version, there is a required order of creation or else there will be errors. There order is as follows:

1. Author Creation
2. Book Creation
3. Loan Creation

From there, you are able to freely modify or delete in any order after the initial creation.
